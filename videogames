  <h1>My experince with videogames
    <h2> My first videogame played </h1>
      <p> my favorite type of entertainment is defenietly videogames. videogames have been a thing since 1958 and i have been been playing since i was 7 years old.
      i first played a videogame on a console at my best friend´s (since elementry) house and we were playing call of duty world war on the wii. it is still one the 
      hardest games that i have ever done because we were trying to do the wii gun with the controllers and it was the hardest thing everytime because we didnt have the
      actual holsters. <img src=¨https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41CkMiqbWyL._SX466_.jpg¨></p>
